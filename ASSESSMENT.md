# Assessment

Build a small, Booking.com-like product focused on the frontend. Creativity encouraged.

## Quick facts

- **Domain:** Travel (hotels or similar stay products).
- **Complexity:** Mid+ (end-to-end flow, not just UI screens).
- **Stack:** React (TypeScript recommended).
- Includes a small backend (server) that your frontend talks to.
- LLM usage for coding is encouraged.
- **Suggested timebox:** 4–6 hours. Stop when you hit the timebox and document what you would do next.

## What you are building

A travel booking web app where a user can discover stays, view details and reviews, and complete a checkout flow. We care more about product thinking and engineering quality than pixel-perfect design.

## Must-have capabilities (keep it simple)

- Search or browse a list of stays (filters and sorting are up to you).
- Stay details page.
- Reviews/comments: list + add a review/comment (moderation can be basic).
- Availability + price display.
- Checkout flow that results in a confirmed booking (payment can be mocked).
- Frontend calls a backend API you provide (even if the data is mocked).

## Where you can be creative

- Choose the exact product scope: hotels, apartments, hostels, experiences, etc.
- Pick your UX: map view, saved favorites, personalized feed, compare stays, etc.
- Decide what "availability" means (date range, rooms, guests) and how deep you go.

## Backend expectations

Keep the backend small. It exists to support your frontend and prove you can design and consume APIs. You can use Node (Express/Fastify/Nest), serverless functions, or a minimal mock server.

**Minimum API surface** (example — you can change it):

- `GET /stays?query=&filters=...` — list/search
- `GET /stays/:id` — details
- `GET /stays/:id/reviews` — reviews
- `POST /stays/:id/reviews` — add review
- `POST /bookings` — create booking / checkout

## Non-functional requirements

- Runs locally with a single command (or a clearly documented two-step setup).
- Responsive layout (desktop + mobile).
- Loading + empty + error states for async screens.
- Basic accessibility (labels, keyboard nav where it matters, sensible focus).
- **Testing:** at least a few meaningful tests (unit and/or integration/e2e).
- **Observability basics:** helpful logging, and optionally a simple metrics/error tool.

## Release process

- CI pipeline (example: GitHub Actions) that runs lint + tests on PR/push.
- Build step that produces a production bundle.
- A simple release approach (example: tags, changelog, version bump).
- Optional but great: deployment to Vercel/Netlify/Render and share the URL.

## What to submit

- Git repository link with full source code (frontend + backend).
- README that includes: setup, scripts, architecture notes, tradeoffs, and what you would do next.
- Short note on LLM usage: what you used it for, prompts/approach, and any guardrails.
- Recording presenting the solution.

## Notes

We do not expect a huge project. We expect smart scope choices. If you cut features, say why. If you make assumptions, write them down.
